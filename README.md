# Machine-Learning-House-Price-Prediction

🚀 Project Overview

This project takes house price prediction beyond simple ML models, transforming it into a full-fledged machine learning pipeline with MLOps integration. From EDA and feature engineering to model development, testing, and deployment, this project ensures you master end-to-end ML workflows like an industry expert.

🎯 Key Objectives

✅ Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.
✅ Engineer robust features that improve model performance.
✅ Implement ML models with proper validation and testing.
✅ Write scalable, reusable, and defensive ML code.
✅ Integrate MLOps tools like ZenML & MLflow for experiment tracking and deployment.
